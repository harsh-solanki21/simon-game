# Simon Game
- It is an old-school game which was introduced in 80s.
- The classic electronic game of sharp memories and fast hands is back to exercise the minds of a 
new generation while giving the older fogies a little neuron nostalgia.

- If you're new to the game, here's how it works: 
  - Just press the start button, watch and listen as the four buttons light up randomly and produce different sounds.
  - Then, press the buttons in the same order to progress to the next round.
  - With each round, the number of buttons to press increases as does the challenge.
